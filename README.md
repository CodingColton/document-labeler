# Document Labeler (for legal exhibits)

## The purpose:
When preparing exhibits for trial, a common workflow is to manually
rename, label, and number each document that will be introduced at trial.
This project allows the user to label and rename any amount of exhibits
automatically, and at the same time.

## How do I use this tool?
1. Download the project
2. Put **COPIES** of the **.pdf** files that you want labeled in the
   "DOCUMENTS-GO-HERE" folder
3. Run the 'main.py' file
4. Input relevant information
5. Done! Now look at your documents in the "DOCUMENTS-GO-HERE" folder. 
   They should be correctly renamed and labeled.

*NOTE: to sample how this works, run the 'main.py' file with the test pdf
documents included in the "DOCUMENTS-GO-HERE" folder.*
